DESCRIPTION
    OOP for the del.icio.us API

PACKAGE METHODS
  __PACKAGE__->new(\%args || Config::Simple)
    Arguments to the Net::Delicious object may be defined in one of three
    ways : As a single hash reference or; As a reference to a
    *Config::Simple* object; as a path to a file that may be read by the
    *Config::Simple*.

    The first option isn't going away any time soon but should be considered
    as deprecated. Valid hash reference arguments are :

    * user
        String. *required*

        Your del.icio.us username.

    * pswd
        String. *required*

        Your del.icio.us password.

    * updates
        String.

        The path to a directory where the timestamp for the last update to
        your bookmarks can be recorded. This is used by the *all_posts*
        method to prevent abusive requests.

        Default is the current user's home directory, followed by a
        temporary directory as determined by File::Temp.

    * debug
        Boolean.

        Add a *Log::Dispatch::Screen* dispatcher to log debug (and higher)
        notices. Notices will be printed to STDERR.

    *Config::Simple* options are expected to be grouped in a "block" labeled
    delicious. Valid options are :

    * user
        String. *required*

        Your del.icio.us username.

    * pswd
        String. *required*

        Your del.icio.us password.

    * updates
        String.

        The path to a directory where the timestamp for the last update to
        your bookmarks can be recorded. This is used by the *all_posts*
        method to prevent abusive requests.

        Default is the current user's home directory, followed by a
        temporary directory as determined by File::Temp.

    * debug
        Boolean.

        Add a *Log::Dispatch::Screen* dispatcher to log debug (and higher)
        notices. Notices will be printed to STDERR.

    Returns a Net::Delicious object or undef if there was a problem creating
    the object.
